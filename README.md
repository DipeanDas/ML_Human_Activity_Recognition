# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

This project focuses on **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using data collected from smartphonesâ€™ embedded sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. The task is to classify physical activities (e.g., walking, sitting, standing, etc.) based on extracted features.

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Normalization and cleaning  
   - Dimensionality reduction explored via **PCA** and **t-SNE**  

2. **Train/Test Split**  
   - Dataset split in **80:20 ratio**  

3. **Models Trained & Tuned**  
   - **Logistic Regression**  
     - Parameters: `{ 'max_iter': [100, 200, 500] }`  
     - Best: `max_iter=500`  
     - Accuracy: **95.5%**  

   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
     - Parameters: `{ 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly', 'sigmoid'], 'C': [100, 50] }`  
     - Best: `kernel='rbf', C=50`  
     - Accuracy: **96.6%**  

   - **Decision Tree**  
     - Parameters: `{ 'max_depth': [2, 4, 6, 8] }`  
     - Best: `max_depth=6`  
     - Accuracy: **83.6%**  

   - **Random Forest**  
     - Parameters: `{ 'n_estimators': [20â€“100], 'max_depth': [2â€“16] }`  
     - Best: `n_estimators=100, max_depth=14`  
     - Accuracy: **91.6%**

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Best performing model**: **SVM (RBF kernel, C=50)** with **96.6% accuracy**  
- Logistic Regression also performed strongly with 95.5% accuracy.  
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest) showed competitive results but slightly lower accuracy compared to SVM.  
- Decision Tree underperformed relative to other approaches.
